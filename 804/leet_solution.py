# Approach #1: Hash Set [Accepted]
# Intuition and Algorithm

# We can transform each word into it's Morse Code representation.

# After, we put all transformations into a set seen, and return the size of the set.

# Complexity Analysis

# Time Complexity: O(S), where S is the sum of the lengths of words in words. We iterate through each character of each word in words.

# Space Complexity: O(S).
